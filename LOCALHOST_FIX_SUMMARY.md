# ‚úÖ Localhost/Forbidden Error - FIXED

## The Problem

You got this error:
```
Job started but payment capture failed: 
Request to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/capture-payment-intent forbidden.
```

### Why This Happened

**Convex actions run in the cloud** (on Convex's servers), NOT on your local machine.

Your code was trying to do this:
```
Convex (cloud) ‚Üí http://localhost:3000 ‚Üí Next.js API (your local machine)
                 ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Can't reach localhost from the cloud!
```

### The Root Cause

In `convex/stripeConnect.ts`, the code was making HTTP requests to:
```typescript
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL; // http://localhost:3000
await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/stripe/capture-payment-intent`, ...);
```

This doesn't work because:
- Convex runs in the cloud
- `localhost:3000` is your local development server
- Cloud servers can't access `localhost` on your machine
- Hence the "forbidden" error

## The Solution

**Call Stripe SDK directly from Convex** instead of proxying through Next.js API routes.

### What Changed

#### Before (Broken):
```
Convex Action ‚Üí HTTP request ‚Üí Next.js API ‚Üí Stripe SDK ‚Üí Stripe
                ‚ùå Fails here (localhost)
```

#### After (Fixed):
```
Convex Action ‚Üí Stripe SDK ‚Üí Stripe
                ‚úÖ Direct call, works perfectly!
```

### Code Changes

1. **Added Stripe SDK to Convex**:
   ```typescript
   // convex/stripeConnect.ts
   const Stripe = require('stripe');
   const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
   ```

2. **Capture Payment** - Now calls Stripe directly:
   ```typescript
   // OLD (broken):
   await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/stripe/capture-payment-intent`, ...);
   
   // NEW (works):
   const capturedPayment = await stripe.paymentIntents.capture(
     job.stripePaymentIntentId
   );
   ```

3. **Payout** - Now calls Stripe directly:
   ```typescript
   // OLD (broken):
   await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/stripe/connect/payout`, ...);
   
   // NEW (works):
   const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
     amount: Math.round(amount * 100),
     destination: connectAccountId,
   });
   ```

4. **Added Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Every step is logged with `console.log`
   - All operations logged to database
   - Detailed error messages with Stripe error codes

## Setup Required

### 1. Install Stripe in Convex

```bash
cd convex
npm install stripe
cd ..
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable

You need to add your Stripe secret key to Convex:

**Option A: Convex Dashboard** (Recommended)
1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your project
3. Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = `sk_test_...`

**Option B: CLI**
```bash
npx convex env set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY sk_test_your_key_here
```

### 3. Push Changes

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will push the new schema (stripeLogs table) and deploy your functions.

## Verification

### Check Console Logs

When you run `npx convex dev`, you should see:
```
=== STRIPE CONNECT DEBUG ===
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY exists: true
```

### Test Payment Capture

1. Create and start a job
2. Watch the Convex logs:
   ```
   === PAYMENT CAPTURE STARTED ===
   Job ID: kjg...
   Payment intent retrieved: { status: 'requires_capture' }
   Capturing payment intent...
   === PAYMENT CAPTURED SUCCESSFULLY ===
   ```

3. Check `/stripe-debug` dashboard for logged operations

## Debugging Capabilities

Now you have **full visibility** into what's happening:

### 1. Console Logs (Convex Dashboard)
```typescript
console.log('=== PAYMENT CAPTURE STARTED ===');
console.log('Job details:', { status, paymentIntentId });
console.log('Payment intent retrieved:', { id, status, amount });
console.log('=== PAYMENT CAPTURED SUCCESSFULLY ===');
```

### 2. Database Logs (stripeLogs table)
Every operation is logged with:
- Operation type
- Status (pending, success, error)
- Job ID
- Payment Intent ID
- Amount
- Error messages
- Request/response data
- Timestamp

### 3. Debug Dashboard (`/stripe-debug`)
- View all operations in real-time
- See errors with full details
- Manually test capture/payout
- Expandable request/response data

### 4. Stripe Dashboard
- See all API calls
- Verify payment intents
- Check transfers
- View Connect accounts

## What You Can Debug Now

### Any Error - Complete Trace:

```
1. Error happens
   ‚Üì
2. Logged to console (Convex dashboard)
   ‚Üì
3. Logged to database (stripeLogs)
   ‚Üì
4. Visible in /stripe-debug
   ‚Üì
5. Full error details with:
   - Error message
   - Stripe error code
   - Request sent
   - Response received
   - Job details
```

### Example Error Flow:

If capture fails:
```javascript
// You'll see in logs:
ERROR: Payment intent is in succeeded state, cannot capture
// With full details:
{
  operation: 'capture_payment',
  status: 'error',
  jobId: 'kjg123...',
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_abc...',
  errorMessage: 'Payment intent is in succeeded state...',
  responseData: '{"currentStatus": "succeeded"}'
}
```

## Advantages

‚úÖ **No more localhost issues** - Works in development and production
‚úÖ **Faster** - Direct API calls, no HTTP overhead  
‚úÖ **Simpler** - Less code, fewer failure points
‚úÖ **Better errors** - Full Stripe error details captured
‚úÖ **Easier debugging** - Multiple layers of logging
‚úÖ **Real-time monitoring** - See everything as it happens
